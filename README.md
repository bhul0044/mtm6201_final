Project Overview:

This project is my personal portfolio website. I'm a UX designer who mixes graphic design and UX magic. The website is constructed with Bootstrap for responsive designconsideredyling, a publicly accessible CSS library is used. Accessibility guidelines and a range of screen sizes are taken into consideration in the design. The concept of design is simple and cute. Navigation is kept simple so that user screen flow is not distrupted. 

 Process:
1. Planning: To start, the structure and layout were outlined in a wireframe. 

2. Development: To put in the layout and guarantee responsiveness, Bootstrap was used. modified the default color palette of Bootstrap using CSS variables. 

3. Accessibility: ensured adequate ARIA responsibilities and semantic HTML. introduced skip links and made sure the internet page could be accessed with a keyboard. Making sure the design seemed nice across all screen sizes was referred to as responsive design. used the responsive classes and grid system provided by Bootstrap to solve this. 



## Challenges and Solutions
- Responsive Design: Making sure the design seemed nice across all screen sizes was referred to as responsive design. used the responsive classes and grid system provided by Bootstrap to solve this.

- Accessibility: ARIA duties and semantic HTML needed to be carefully taken into account in order to make the website accessible. utilized diiferent accessibility standards to keep it simple and helpful for audience. 

- Responsive design: I am stuck on the part of responsive even though pictures are shifting its postition according to the frame provided I was not able to go in depth of the image optimization. However, Learning is a ongoing process  not limited to due dates. If not now I will be able to do it next 6 months.



## Learnings

- Accessibility Best Practices: Gained a deeper understanding of web accessibility and how to implement it.
- Thought-process: Changes in my thought process realted to design. I have learnt that website needs to be easy to access along side beautiful but not too design heavy so that user donot just keep on thinking were to go next.
