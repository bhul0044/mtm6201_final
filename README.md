# Ashnoor's Portfolio

## Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website for Ashnoor, a UX designer who combines UX magic with graphic artistry. The website is built using Bootstrap for responsive design and a publicly available CSS library for additional styling. The design is optimized for various screen sizes and accessibility standards.

## Process
1. **Planning**: Started with a wireframe to outline the layout and structure.
2. **Development**: Used Bootstrap to implement the layout and ensure responsiveness. Customized Bootstrap's default color scheme using CSS variables.
3. **Accessibility**: Ensured semantic HTML and proper ARIA roles. Implemented skip links and ensured the site is navigable via keyboard.
4. **Optimization**: Used the `<picture>` tag to serve responsive images and optimized images for faster loading times.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the design looked good on all screen sizes. Solved this by using Bootstrap's grid system and responsive classes.
- **Accessibility**: Making the site accessible required careful consideration of semantic HTML and ARIA roles. Used tools like Lighthouse to check and improve accessibility.
- **Image Optimization**: Ensured images were responsive and optimized. Used different sizes of images and the `<picture>` tag for better performance.

## Learnings
- **Bootstrap Customization**: Learned how to effectively use and customize Bootstrap using CSS variables.
